On August 30th, the Turkish nation was with me in the battle I led and directed. Do you know how strong a person feels when he acts together with his nation? This is difficult to describe. You will forgive me if I have difficulty in describing it.
Fools think that the country will be saved by abandoning it to the American mandate and British patronage. They are sacrificing a homeland and the Turkish independence that has lasted throughout history to ensure their own comfort!
There is no issue that reason and logic cannot solve.
America, Europe and the entire civilized world must know that the people of Turkey, like every civilized and capable nation, have firmly decided to live unconditionally free and independent. Any force that tries to overturn this rightful decision will remain the eternal enemy of Turkey.
Anatolia is the greatest treasure.
If, like our friends and all members of the nation, I have also contributed to our national cause, if there is strength and success in this work, do not attribute it to me. Attribute it only and only to the spiritual personality of the whole nation. I am happy to be an insignificant individual within this high spiritual personality of the nation. My lords, the nation as a whole has emerged as a spiritual personality and as a united mass, and by preserving this supreme unity, it has eliminated those who were hostile to it.
Turkey is no longer a stage for the games of religion and sharia. If there are such players, they should look for a stage elsewhere.
Those who have governed Turkey for centuries have thought of many things, but they have not thought of only one thing: Turkey... There is only one way to compensate for the damages suffered by the Turkish homeland and the Turkish nation because of this thoughtlessness: And that is to think of nothing but Turkey in Turkey from now on. Only by acting with this mentality, we can achieve all kinds of peace and prosperity goals.
I have no doubt that the forgotten civilized quality and great civilized capability of Turkishness, with its future development, will rise like a new sun on the horizon of the high civilization of the future. On the day when these words of mine come true, my wish for you and for all civilized humanity is this: Remember me.
We have done many and great things in a short time. The greatest of these works is the Republic of Turkey, the foundation of which is Turkish heroism and high Turkish culture.
On the day I set out for Samsun in May 1919, I had no material force at my disposal. I had only a high and spiritual force arising from the nobility of the great Turkish nation and filling my conscience. It was this national force, this Turkish nation, in which I started my work.
I do not leave as my spiritual inheritance any absolute certainty, any dogma, any frozen, stereotyped rule. My spiritual inheritance is knowledge and reason. Those who want to follow me after me will be my spiritual heirs if they accept the guidance of reason and science on this basic axis.
I forgive them because I have a heart; they do not forgive me because they are heartless.
I don't want to get married just for the sake of getting married. To create a new family life in our homeland, I must first set an example myself. Can a woman remain like a bogeyman?
Even in battle, I do not bear a grudge against the enemy; I think only of the application of military rules.
Seeing me is not necessarily seeing my face. It is enough if you understand and feel my ideas, my emotions.
I have a reputation for being a heavy drinker. You will have heard that too. As a matter of fact, I have been drinking for a long time, I like to drink. But I stop drinking when I want to. I never put a drop in my mouth during my duty. I do not mix liquor in the affairs of the homeland. Drinking and duty are two different things. Where they affect each other, one should of course prefer duty to pleasure and stop drinking at all costs.
I don't have a religion, and sometimes I wish all religions would go to the bottom of the sea. It is weak rulers who need to use religion to keep their government going. They trap the people in a trap. My people will learn the principles of democracy, the dictates of truth and the teachings of science. Superstition must be abandoned. Anyone can worship as they wish. Everyone follows the voice of his conscience. But this behavior must neither contradict common sense nor lead to opposition to the freedom of others.
I have nothing in my eyes; I am only a lover of merit.
My humble body will surely one day turn to dust, but the Republic of Turkey will endure forever. And the Turkish nation will continue to walk on the path of civilization, without hesitation, with the principles that guarantee security and happiness.
My duties to the Turkish nation, Turkish society and the future of Turkishness are not finished; you will complete them. You should repeat my words to those who come after you.
Is a government good or bad? In order to understand which government is good or bad, it is necessary to think about "What is the purpose of the government?" The government has two goals. One is to protect the nation, and the second is to ensure the welfare of the nation. A government that ensures these two things is good, and a government that fails to do so is bad.
To put it in one word, we can say that the new Turkish State is a people's state; it is the state of the people. The institutions of the past were a state of individuals, a state of personalities.
What can a society lack? There are forces that make a nation a nation, that advance and develop it: The forces of thought, social forces. When thoughts are full of meaningless, useless, inconceivable nonsense, those thoughts are diseased. Also, if social life is full of useless, harmful customs and traditions that are far from reason and logic, it cannot be considered life. It cannot progress, it cannot develop, it flounders where it is, like a cow.
We will always tell each other the truth. Whether it brings disaster or happiness, good or bad, we will always stick to the truth.
The progress of a nation depends on the education of its youth.
There may come a time when there may be efforts to forget me or make me forget. There may be those who deny and denigrate my ideas. They may even be among those I know and believe in. However, the seeds we have sown are so succinct and strong that these ideas will come back from India and Egypt, and their fruitful results will fill the hearts.
For a work to have moral value, it must emanate from a higher source than individual people. That source is the community, the nation. In fact, morality, apart from and above private individuals, can only be social, national. It is national morality that demands from people interest, zeal, self-sacrifice and, when necessary, willing sacrifice of self for the sake of the nation's social order and tranquility, its prosperity, happiness, well-being and prosperity in the present and future, and its progress and development in civilization. In a perfect nation, the obligations of national morality are made by the people of that nation almost without reasoning, on a conscientious, emotional impulse. This is the greatest national feeling, national excitement. The aim of the national education that national mothers, national fathers, national teachers and national elders will give tirelessly and continuously to the children of the nation, to every member of the nation, at home, at school, in the army, in the factory, everywhere and at every work, should be to strengthen this high national feeling. To say that morality is national and social, and that it is an expression of the divine conscience, is at the same time to recognize the sacred character of morality. Morality is sacred because it has no equal in value and cannot be measured by any other kind of value. Morality is sacred because it is attributed to an agent with the highest moral intentions. That agent is society and society alone. There is no other agent but it. In the divinity, even the community, conceived in an exemplary way, is inherent. This is because the spiritual life that affects our consciences is formed from the deeds and actions of the members of the community. In fact, society is a center of intense intellectual and moral activity.
We do not adopt Western civilization for the sake of emulation. We adopt what we see as good in it because we find it suitable for our own structure, within the level of world civilization.
When we say ignorant, we do not mean those who have not studied at school. We mean knowledge, knowing the truth.
We are a people who struggle for life and independence, and whose hearts bleed when they see the entire civilized world standing by as numb spectators in the face of these bloody struggles.
We make use of every means on the basis of one and only one fundamental view. That vision is this: To raise the Turkish nation to its rightful place in the civilized world, to strengthen the Republic of Turkey every day more and more on its unshakable foundations ... and for this purpose, to kill the idea of tyranny...
We are neither like democrats nor socialists. Our style of governance is neither that of democratic governments nor that of socialists. We are proud to be like ourselves.
In our opinion, in the meaning of the Republic of Turkey, woman is a high and honorable being at the most respectable level, above all else, today as in the entire Turkish history.
The evil-doers who have led us astray have often disguised themselves under the veil of religion and have always deceived our pure and clean people with the words of religious rules. Read and listen to our history... You will see that the evils that have ruined, enslaved and devastated nations have always come from blasphemy and evil under the cover of religion.
Our main program in state administration is the program of the Republican People's Party. The principles contained in it are the main lines that enlighten us in administration and politics. However, these principles should never be equated with the dogmas of books supposed to have come down from the sky. We draw our inspiration directly from life, not from heaven and the unseen. It is the country we live in, the Turkish nation from whose bosom we sprang, and the conclusions we have drawn from the thousands of leaves of the history of nations, which record a thousand and one disasters and sufferings, that draw our path.
Our nation is essentially democratic. The deepest past phases of its culture and traditions confirm this.
Our intellectuals should work on this. Why don't they come to Anatolia and try! Why don't they have direct contact with the nation! They should visit the country, get to know the nation. They should see what is lacking and show it. This is how to love the nation. Otherwise, words are useless!
Today there are many of our co-religionists who are suffering in captivity. It is our greatest wish that they, too, gain their independence in their own environment and strive for the prosperity and advancement of their countries with complete independence.
Today, our government, our state organization is a state organization and government that the nation has directly and spontaneously created by itself, and its name is the Republic. There is no longer the old separation between the government and the nation. The government is the nation and the nation is the government. Now the government and the members of the government have fully understood that they are not separate from the nation and that the nation is the master.
Making laws that meet today's needs and enforcing them well is one of the most important means of prosperity and progress.
Bulgarians, Serbs, Hungarians, Romanians stuck to their ploughs, preserved their existence and grew stronger; our nation was a vagabond behind such conquerors...
As it has been the case for so many centuries, even today, the existence of those who attempt to use religion as a tool and instrument to achieve a thousand kinds of political and personal purposes and benefits by taking advantage of the ignorance and prejudice of nations, both inside and outside, unfortunately does not keep us away from speaking out on this issue.
A dictator is someone who suppresses the will of the people and compels them to obey. I do not want to break hearts, I want to win hearts.
Everything we see on the face of the earth is the work of women.
The truest guide for everything in the world, for material, spiritual, life and success is knowledge and science. To seek guidance outside of science and science is heedlessness, ignorance and deviation from the right path. It is essential to understand the development of science and science in every minute of our lives and to follow the progress in a timely manner.
If there is no peace, tranquility and good living in the world and among the nations of the world, a nation is deprived of peace, no matter what it does for itself.
Nowhere in the world, in any nation, is it possible to mention women's work above that of the Anatolian peasant woman, and no woman of any nation in the world can say, "I have worked harder than the Anatolian woman, I have worked as hard as the Anatolian woman to lead my nation to liberation and victory".
It is painful for a country and its people to be harmed by the enemy. But it is even more painful for a country to be harmed by its own people, whom it considers to be great and whom it has placed at the head of its people. This is an unexpected wound for the heart and conscience.
Our nation is a self-sacrificing people for its homeland, for its freedom and sovereignty; it has proved it.
The family life is the nucleus, the cornerstone of social life. The family, needless to say, is composed of men and women. I will not say as much about our women as I have said about our men, but I cannot pass over this sublime existence with indulgence, especially in their presence. If you allow me, I will say a few words and you will easily understand what I want to say. During my travels, not only in villages, but especially in towns and cities, I have seen that our female friends cover their faces and eyes very tightly and carefully. Especially in this hot season, I imagine that this style must be a source of torment and agony for them. Male friends, this is a little bit the work of our hodgepodge. It is the result of our being very forgiving and very careful. But, dear friends, our women, like us, are also conscious and thoughtful people. In order to inculcate in them a strong sense of morality, to explain our national morality and to educate their minds with light and kindness, there is no need to be too hodgepodge. Let them show their faces to the world. And let them see the world carefully with their eyes. There is nothing to fear in this.
Know well that the Republic of Turkey cannot be a country of sheikhs, dervishes, disciples and followers. The truest and most authentic order is the order of civilization. Doing what civilization commands and demands is enough to be human.
Gentlemen, the Turkish people who founded the Republic of Turkey are civilized. Civilized in history, civilized in reality. But I am obliged to inform you as your own brother, friend and father that the people of the Republic of Turkey, who say they are civilized, have to prove and demonstrate that they are civilized with their ideas and minds. The people of the Republic of Turkey, who say they are civilized, have to show that they are civilized with their family life and the way they live. In other words, the truly civilized people of Turkey, who claim to be civilized, are obliged to demonstrate in practice that they are civilized and advanced people, even in their external life. I must make these last words clear so that the whole country and the world can understand what I mean. I would like to make this explanation by posing a question to your delegation, to the general public. Is our dress national? (No, no shouts) Is our dress civilized and international? (No, no shouts) I agree with you. No, no, no. Pardon my expression. A dress that can be described as a shabby dress is neither national nor international. Then a nation without clothes? Is that possible, friends? Are you willing to be described like this, friends? (No, no, absolutely not) Is there any point in plastering a very precious gem with mud and showing it to the enzori world? And the ore is hidden in this mud. But is it appropriate to say that you do not understand? It is necessary and natural to throw the mud in order to show the ore. If it is necessary to make a casing for the preservation of the ore, shouldn't it be made of gold or platinum? Is it permissible to hesitate in the face of such a clear truth? If there are those who make us hesitate, will we still hesitate to judge their humku belahat? Friends, there is no need to search for and revive the Turanian costume. The civilized and international dress is very valuable for us and worthy for our nation. We will adopt it. We will adopt it. We will wear a pair of skates or photins on the feet, trousers on the legs, a vest, a shirt, a tie, a collar, a jacket and, of course, as an integral part of all these, a serape with a parasol on the head. I would like to say this very clearly: The name of this garment is called a hat. Like the redingot, like the bonjour, like the tuxedo, like the frock coat... Here is our hat. There are those who say it is not permissible. To them I say, you are very ignorant and very ignorant. And I would like to ask them: Why is it permissible to wear the fez, which is the Greek serape, but not the hat, and again I would like to remind them and the whole nation, when, why and how did they wear the robe, which was the dress of the Byzantine priests and Jewish rabbis?
If a nation is great, it becomes greater by knowing itself.
The way of education and training is to make knowledge a practical and usable device for success in material life, rather than an ornament, an instrument of tyranny, or a civilized pleasure.
The sovereignty belongs to the nation unconditionally.
Imperialism is doomed to die.
The best individuals are those who care more about the society to which they belong than about themselves, and who give their lives to the protection of its existence and happiness.
It is important that boys and girls receive the same education. The children of the country must be equipped to be active, effective and successful in economic life. They must be raised with our national morality, civilized principles and free ideas. The so-called morality born of oppression and fear is not only not a virtue, it is also unreliable.
O heroic Turkish woman, you are worthy not to crawl on the ground, but to rise to the skies on shoulders.
Compared to the past time, we will work harder. We will accomplish greater things in less time. I have no doubt that we will succeed in this too. Because the character of the Turkish nation is high. The Turkish nation is hardworking. The Turkish nation is intelligent. Because the Turkish nation knows how to overcome difficulties with national unity and solidarity.
Our young people and intellectuals must first decide in their own minds what they are marching for and what they are going to do, make them digestible and acceptable to the public, and only then put them forward.
Raise the youth. Give them the positive ideas of knowledge and wisdom. With them you will reach the light of the future. When free ideas are put into practice, the Turkish nation will rise.
Do not be afraid to speak the truth.
Success in fine arts is the surest proof of the success of all revolutions. It is a pity for nations that cannot succeed in this. Despite all their achievements, they will always be deprived of being recognized as high humanity in the field of civilization.
Those who really want to serve the country must have an open heart; they must speak openly. The people and those who lead and manage the nation should talk very openly. Things that have happened and things to be done must be stated as they are. Otherwise, to deceive the nation with sophistry is to pit them against each other. Our rule must always be to speak the truth to the nation. This is what enlightening the nation means.
Sovereignty and sovereignty are not given by anyone to anyone through negotiation and discussion, because it is a matter of science. Sovereignty and sultanate are taken by force, power and force. The Osmanoğulları had taken the sovereignty and sultanate of the Turkish nation by force, and they had maintained this domination for six centuries. Now, the Turkish nation has put these transgressors in their place and has taken sovereignty and sultanate into its own hands through rebellion. This is an order. It is not a question of whether or not we are going to give the nation its sovereignty and sovereignty. This is not the issue. It is a matter of expressing a reality that has already been decreed. This will, inevitably, happen. If those gathered here, the assembly and everyone sees the matter as natural, it will be appropriate in my opinion. Otherwise, the truth will still be expressed in its proper way. But possibly some heads will be cut off.
The last breath of every individual must show that the breath of the Turkish nation will not be extinguished, that it is eternal. Rise up, Turk! There is no limit to your height. This is the motto.
If those who serve in any way expect great rewards from the nation, they are not acting in the right way. We should not ask too much from the nation. Those who serve have done nothing but fulfill their duty of honor.
First of all, it is necessary to eliminate ignorance. For this reason, the cornerstone of our education program and education policy is the elimination of ignorance. Unless this is eliminated, we are in our place. Something that stands still means it is going backwards.
Despite everything, we are definitely walking towards a light. The force that keeps this belief alive in me is not only my unshared love for my beloved country and nation, but also the fact that I see a youth who, in the darkness, immorality and charlatanism of today, is trying to spread and seek light out of love for the homeland and the truth. Here, my dear Ruşen Eşref Bey, I see you as a natural member of this blessed faction. I look forward to your more important services day by day. I am pleased to be able to know you today, who is more destined for the gratitude and admiration of tomorrow than today.
Nations that insist on the preservation of certain traditions and beliefs that are not based on any coherent evidence will find it very difficult to advance, perhaps not at all. Nations that cannot overcome the terms and conditions of traditions in progress cannot see life in accordance with reason and reality.
Never forget that the Republic demands from you generations who are free of thought, free of conscience and free of wisdom.
The reason for the existence of the government is to ensure public order in the country and the peace and comfort of the nation. Real order must prevail throughout the country. The nation must be at ease in great peace and security. Those who attempt to disrupt the confidence of the people, the integrity and order of the state in any corner of our country must find all the forces of the state against them.
In a country without freedom, there is death and decadence. Freedom is the mother of every progress and salvation.
Freedom and independence are my character. I am a man created with the love of independence, which is the most precious heritage of my nation and my great ancestors.
The hallmark of progressive government is the ability to make the people sincerely believe in its compassion as well as its power.
The distinctive feature of advanced governmentalism is its ability to make the people sincerely believe in its compassion as well as its power. It would be very appropriate to give importance to the development of this mentality to the greatest extent in all officials of the republic, large and small.
Those who understand the goal of the Revolution will always be able to protect it.
It is necessary to deepen and support the foundations of the revolution every day. Let us not deceive each other, the civilized world is far ahead. We are obliged to catch up with it, to be included in that circle of civilization.
In social life, people can be considered in a web of rights and duties. As long as people remain human, they cannot get out of this web.
The force that dominates human life and activity is creativity and the ability to invent. It has become clear that people who are capable of invention and creativity must be cultured.
Prosperity for all of humanity must replace hunger and oppression. The citizens of the world must be educated away from envy, greed and hatred.
These vagabonds, dreaming of doing something, founded a party called TKP, ostensibly to benefit our country and nation. Mustafa Suphi and others like him are at the head of this party. In my opinion, they did not directly act out of patriotic feelings and real national feelings, but perhaps to curry favor with the principals in Moscow who gave them money, protected them and protected them. Their attempt was to introduce Russian Bolshevism into the country through various channels.
Our women will have knowledge and science and will pass through all the educational steps that men pass through. Women will walk together with men in social life and be each other's helpers and supporters.
Getting along well with its neighbors and all states is the essence of Turkish politics.
We do not accept exceptions to any part of the capitulations. We do not recognize any of the judicial, financial or military capitulations.
Raising our girls to be capable of defending and protecting the high interests of the homeland and the nation should be the basis of national education. And it is essential to give our girls intellectual competence. There is no doubt that Turkish women are essentially geniuses. Turkish women have expressed their desire to be included in the political class that manages the destiny of the country on behalf of the nation. Therefore, we cannot keep our women away from any civic duty. Because all rights arise from duties.
Communism is a social issue. The social conditions of our country and the strength of our religious and national traditions confirm our conviction that communism in Russia is not suitable for us. Therefore, our relations and relations with the Russians are related only to the principles of union and alliance of two independent states.
The peasant is the benefactor of all of us. We will think about the welfare of this noble element.
You know that our hearts are trembling as a nation over our cultural affairs. At the forefront of these works, I must tell you that we are working sincerely to establish Turkish history on its correct foundations and to give the Turkish language the breadth it deserves. We can already believe that these works will reach dazzling results.
We continue to organize our cultural examination according to new and modern principles. The Turkish History and Language studies are already showing their much-anticipated and highly promising results.
I listened attentively to what His Majesty the King said. Do they want me to advise a head of state to cede a piece of his country to the Germans? How can a man like me, who has fought all his life for the independence of his country and not to give an inch of its land to anyone else, be the instrument of something contrary to his beliefs? I see, Your Majesty the King, that they do not know me and my character well!
Since the Office of the Sultan is also the Office of the Caliphate, our Sultan is also the Head of the Republic of Islam.
Wealth and property weigh me down. It is a great relief to give them back to my noble nation. What is the use of wealth; one's wealth should be in one's own spiritual personality!
Our national power, which is formed and manifested in our Assembly, will liberate the office of the Caliphate and the Sultanate from foreign pressure and will take measures to save the Ottoman State from disintegration and captivity. The whole civilized world and humanity will help you by following our actions step by step with the belief that a nation which enjoys full independence, which is proud of its conscientious attachment to the office of the Caliphate and which sees in itself the understanding of living within the Islamic world cannot be a captive.
Resistance against the raging flood of civilization is futile and it is relentless against the ignorant and disobedient. In the face of the might and greatness of civilization, which pierces mountains, flies in the skies, sees, illuminates and examines everything from invisible particles to the stars, nations that try to walk with medieval mentalities and primitive superstitions are doomed to perish, or at least to be enslaved and humiliated. However, the people of the Republic of Turkey have decided to live forever as an innovative and developed nation, and have shattered the chains of bondage with unique heroism in history.
Uncivilized people are doomed to be trampled under the feet of the civilized.
In the affairs of the country, in the affairs of the nation, in real affairs, feelings, memories, brotherhood and friendship are not considered.
I have no other aim than to work for the salvation and happiness of the country and the nation. This provides enough joy and pleasure for a human being. My friends who are with me and all my fellow citizens pursue the same goal. They have realized in a real and serious way that personal and family peace and happiness are sustained by the peace and happiness of the nation and are possible only with the security and inviolability of the country. I and those who are with me are convinced of the greatness of our goal and the correctness of our path. We have no doubt or hesitation in this. We have the necessary knowledge of the recent and distant history of our nation, the Turkish nation. We are not deprived of the care to keep the lessons of the past in mind for the life of today and the future. We do not boast of the services we have done. We are consoled by the hope that the services we will do can be a reason for pride.
We cannot enclose our country in a circle and live irrelevant to the world. On the contrary, we will live above the level of civilization as an elevated, advanced, civilized nation. This life can only be achieved through science and science. We will be wherever science and science are and we will put them in the minds of every member of the nation. There are no conditions for science and science.
May the nation regain its independence, and may the sultanate and the great and exalted caliphate be saved from extinction. I ask you to believe this by declaring that my eternal devotion is ever increasing.
The nation took its sovereignty and took it by rebelling. The sovereignty that has been taken cannot be abandoned or returned for any reason or in any way. In order to regain this sovereignty, it is necessary to use the means that have already been used.
I explained to the nation that in order for a caliph, who is imagined to be charged with the duty of establishing an Islam-wide state, to fulfill his duty, the State of Turkey and its handful of inhabitants cannot be subjected to the orders of the caliph. The nation cannot consent to this! The people of Turkey cannot bear such a great responsibility, such an illogical duty. For centuries, our nation has been driven by this unbelievable point of view. But what happened?! It left millions of people wherever it went. Do you know how many Anatolian sons perished in the deserts of Yemen? Do you know how many people perished in order to protect Syria, Iraq, to find shelter in Egypt, to hold on in Africa? Those who want to make the Caliph challenge the world and make him the ruler of the whole of Islam must demand this task not only from the people of Anatolia, but also from the great masses of Islam, eight to ten times its population! The new Turkey and the people of the new Turkey no longer have anything to think about but their own life and happiness... I made the following statement in order to emphasize another point in the eyes of the people: Suppose for a moment, I said, that Turkey accepts this mission... Let's assume for a moment that Turkey accepts the task in question... Let's assume that it marches towards the goal of unifying the whole Islamic world and directing and managing it, and that it even succeeds! Very well, but if the nations we want to take under our sovereignty and rule say, "Thank you for your great services and assistance, but we want to remain independent. We do not approve of anyone interfering in our independence and sovereignty! We are capable of governing and managing ourselves! In that case, will all the hard work and sacrifice of the people of Turkey be sacrificed just to receive thanks and prayers? It was seen that they wanted to destroy the people of Turkey for a whim, for a delusion, for a dream. This was the nature of the idea of giving duties and powers to the Caliphate and the Caliph.
There is no master over the nation; there is service. He who serves this nation becomes its master.
In the political and social life of our nation, in the intellectual education of our nation, our guide will be science and technique.
It is our national ideal to develop the high character, tireless industriousness, innate intelligence, devotion to science, love for fine arts and sense of national unity of our nation by constantly nurturing them through all means and measures. This ideal, which suits the Turkish nation very well, will lead it to success in fulfilling its civilized duty to provide true peace for all mankind.
The fate of those who do not follow the will and aspiration of the nation is disappointment, annihilation.
National aspirations and national will are not the thoughts of a single individual, but the unification of the desires and aspirations of all the members of the nation.
I owe it to my conscience and honor to give my life for the sake of national sovereignty.
The national goal is clear. It is not difficult to find ways to reach it. The important thing is to work on those difficult paths. It can be said that we do not need anything. We only need one thing very much: To be hardworking. If we analyze our social diseases, we cannot discover any other, more important disease; this is the disease. Therefore, our first job is to treat this disease in a fundamental way. To make the nation industrious. Wealth and its natural consequence, prosperity and happiness, are the right of the industrious and only the industrious.
We cannot abandon our national defense until the flags of the enemies are removed from the hearths of our fathers. We are obliged to continue our struggle as long as enemy soldiers walk around the temples of Istanbul, as long as the feet of foreign men are not removed from the lands of our homeland.
People who are not cheerful are suspected in two ways. Either he is sick, or he has a delusion that he does not want to inform others about.
No force can save a nation that wants to die. The Turkish nation does not want to die; it will always live, gentlemen!
A society consisting of people with a common will to protect the heritage they have and to sustain it together is called a nation.
Sincere friends are condemned to a torture by their loved ones, and that torture is to listen to the troubles of their loved ones.
We respect every opinion, provided it is sincere and legitimate. Every opinion is honorable for us. No matter how great political and military victories are, if they are not crowned with economic victories, the achievements cannot survive and last.
Complete independence is the essence of the duty we have taken upon ourselves today. This duty is owed to the whole nation and to history.
When history tells the story of the Turkish Revolution, it will first and foremost say that it was a liberation. Among the various stages of this liberation, it will especially mention the liberation of women.
Writing history is as important as making history. If the writer is not faithful to the maker, the unchanging truth will take on a nature that will baffle humanity.
The fundamental principle is for the Turkish nation to live as a dignified and honorable nation. This principle can only be ensured by having full independence. A nation deprived of independence, no matter how rich and prosperous it may be, cannot be worthy of anything higher than servitude before civilized humanity.
I won't stop until all Turkish lands are liberated.
Peace at home, peace in the world, which is one of the most fundamental principles of the Turkish Republic, must be the most fundamental factor in the prosperity and progress of humanity and civilization. It is an act of pride for us that we have served and are serving this cause to the best of our ability.
The first aim of the Turkish Government is to give freedom and happiness to the people, to take care of our soldiers as well as our civilians.
Culture is the foundation of the Republic of Turkey. Culture is reading, understanding, being able to see, making sense of what you can see, getting insight, thinking, and educating the mind.
We should make use of every means of publication in order to simplify and enrich the Turkish language and make the public adopt it. Every intellectual should be able to pay attention to this when writing on any subject, and we should make our spoken language harmonious and beautiful.
The Turk is a nation that does not accept bondage. The Turkish nation has never been captive.
Turkish youth will march to the goal, our high ideal, without stopping, without tiring. And we will be happy to see this.
The Turkish nation has proved through great events that it is a nation of innovators and reformers.
The Turkish nation is a state governed by a republic, which is an administration of the people. The Turkish State is secular. Every adult is free to choose his religion.
The language of the Turkish nation is Turkish. Turkish language is the most beautiful, richest and easiest language in the world. For this reason, every Turk loves his language very much and works to raise it... Turkish language is a sacred treasure for the Turkish nation. Because the Turkish nation sees that its morals, traditions, memories, interests, in short, everything that makes it a nation today has been preserved thanks to its language. Turkish language is the heart and mind of the Turkish nation.
...There is another aspect of the Turkish nation that seems to be common. Indeed, if one pays attention, Turks have more or less the same morals. This high morality is unlike the morality of any other nation. Morality plays a very important role in the formation of a nation. In order to understand this importance, it would not be too much to say a few words about morality. When I say morality, I do not mean the advice written in books on morality, because the things we do and the things we refrain from doing, which we call morality, predate the things written in books or recommended by some moral teachers, and are done by people apart from those words, those advice, without paying any attention to them. Business is the judge, the ruler of the theory. The way in which the rules of morality should be practiced is understood after seeing and experiencing the things that are understood to be moral.
The most suitable administration for the nature and customs of the Turkish nation is the Republican administration.
On the path of progress and civilization that the Turkish nation is walking, the torch that it holds in its hands and mind is scientific knowledge.
Turkish nationalism is the preservation of the special characteristics and independent identity of Turkish society, while walking in parallel and in harmony with all modern nations in international contacts and relations on the path of progress and development.
It is a pleasing event for all of us to see that the Turkish History and Language Institutions have become very valuable and important scientific institutions enlightening the Turkish national existence. The Historical Society has already begun to fulfill its cultural mission to the whole scientific world with the congresses it has organized, the exhibitions it has established, and the artifacts it has unearthed through excavations in Turkey.
In the meaning of the Republic of Turkey, as in the entire Turkish history, woman is a high and honorable being above all else, occupying the most prestigious position.
The people of Turkey who founded the Republic of Turkey are called the Turkish nation.
The independence of the Turkish State is sacred. It must be ensured and protected forever.
If Turkey has set a good example with its struggle against imperialism, I will be very happy.
The people of Turkey are the heroic sons of a nation that has lived free and independent for centuries and has considered independence a necessity of life. This nation has not, cannot and will not live without independence.
Turks are friends of all civilized nations.
The dignity, honor and capability of the Turk is very high and great. It is better for such a nation to perish than to live in captivity. Therefore, either independence or death!
War is murder unless the life of the nation is threatened.
Success on the path of civilization depends on innovation. This is the only way of development and progress to be successful in social life, economic life, science and science.
Walking and succeeding on the path of civilization is a condition of life. Those who pause on this path, or who are ignorant and foolish enough to look backwards rather than forwards on it, are doomed to drown under the raging flood of general civilization.
Freedom of conscience is absolute and inviolable and must be recognized as one of the most important natural rights of the individual.
Accepting the patronage and support of a foreign state is nothing but an admission of incompetence and sloth, of lack of human qualities.
We never consider what we have done as enough. Because we are obliged and determined to do more and greater things. We will raise our country to the level of the most prosperous and civilized countries of the world. We will provide our nation with the widest means and sources of prosperity. We will raise our national culture above the level of contemporary civilization.
Life is short. Marriage is the way people generally see fit to celebrate and crown it. The exceptions to this general rule are few and far between. The exceptions to this rule are those who are more unhappy, not because of the badness of the original rule, but because they are influenced by reasons that prevent them from believing in this good rule, perhaps because they are afraid of getting married. It is an undeniable fact that people, life, cannot exist without women. Those who are married have secured the essentials of life and have directed all their thoughts and aspirations towards a purpose, a vocation, a goal. May fortune favor the hearts and souls of the spouses!
The heart of a newly married person is full of life, love and happiness. This is a most precious time. People remember these bright and joyful moments in their lives as a very important and historical event in their lives, feeling the same way until they die. I have not tried this, but I have come to this conclusion because I have studied life and people a little. Those who have seen a few of the various aspects of life inevitably observe the unexplored aspects after marriage. This observation can be very sweet or very bitter.
Poor woman is taken to mean a woman who has nothing. However, the being called woman is itself a high being. She cannot be poor. Calling a woman poor means the poverty of the whole humanity that comes from her bosom.
One of the historical qualities of the Turkish nation, which is a high human society, is to love and excel in fine arts. For this reason, it is our national ideal to nurture and develop our nation's high character, tireless industriousness, natural intelligence, devotion to science, love for fine arts and sense of national unity continuously and through all means and measures.
In the coming years, we will make more efforts to reach a high and revolutionary level of culture. It is the clear wish of our main policy to raise a virtuous, strong generation based on the foundations of the physical sciences, who love the fine arts, and who are as gifted and talented in physical education as they are in intellectual education.
I once went through books and wanted to understand what philosophers said about life. Some of them saw everything as black. "Since we are nothing and we will reach zero, there is no room for joy and happiness during our temporary life on earth," they said. I read other books, written by wiser men. They were saying: "Since the end is zero anyway, let us at least be joyful and cheerful as long as we live." For my own character I like the second view of life, but within these limits: A man who sees the existence of all mankind in his own person is pathetic. Obviously that man will perish as an individual. What is necessary for any man to be satisfied and happy as long as he lives is not to work for himself, but for those who will come after him. Only in this way can a man of understanding act. Complete pleasure and happiness in life can only be found in working for the honor, existence and happiness of future generations...
